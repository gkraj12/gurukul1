// Write a program in which user will enter two positive integers and those two integers will be passed to another function fun.

// The fun function will perform the addition of the two and will print the output.

// Note that, output will be printed inside fun function.

 
function fun(a, b) {

// Example usage:
const num1 = 7;
const num2 = 5;
fun(num1, num2); // Output: 12
